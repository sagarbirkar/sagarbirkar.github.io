    <p>As a child, I always wanted to explore the world.
    I started of as a researcher and then switched to software development.
    This enabled me to gain insights into both academic and business world.
    <p>
   <p> Apart from working, I have several hobbies. I am deeply fond of performing
     arts like music and dance. Reading is a passion and follow scientific literature.
      I have always idolized musicians, dancers and scientists. I idolize Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar
     for his exemplary work.
    <p>
    <p> Learning Languages is also a love. I follow scientific development
      more than any other news. I hunt mostly detective series on the internet
      and love running in the parks. I am an avid fitness enthusiast and a football fan.
      Liverpool FC and Bengaluru FC are favorites. Recently I have started watching
      and supporting women's football on equal footing.

      <p> I am concerned about the climate and environmental issues that plague our lives on this planet.
      As an activist, we have a family run NGO which does waste segregation for the city of Mumbai.
      You can read all about our NGO <a href= "https://5rcycle.org/"> 5R Cycle </a>. Another concern that
      I am try to address is the health infrastructure. This needs activism at multiple levels and
      is most important post the COVID-19 pandemic.

      <p>
      My continous state is of learning and making myself rich by all means. Lately, I have
      been interested in more of finance related tech development as I feel
      its falling behind the social media companies in terms of real time processing.
