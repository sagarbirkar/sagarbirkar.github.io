    <p>As a child, I always wanted to explore the world.
    I started of as a researcher and then switched to software development.
    This enabled me to gain insights into both academic and business world.
    <p>
   <p> Apart from working, I have several hobbies. I am deeply fond of performing
     arts like music and dance. Reading is a passion and follow scientific literature.
      I have always idolized musicians, dancers and scientists. I idolize Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar
     for his exemplary work.
    <p>
    <p> Learning Languages is also a love. I follow scientific development
      more than any other news. I hunt mostly detective series on the internet
      and love running in the parks. I am an avid fitness enthusiast. My continous
      state is of learning and making myself rich by all means. Lately, I have
      been interested in more of finance related tech development as I feel
      its falling behind the social media companies.
